        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>A screen reader, for instance, is software which reads text and conveys context to their users.  It also allows users to skip around the page from header to header, making it possible for them to “skim” a page like many people do visually. It will also tell them how many items are in a list, how many columns & rows a table has, or that a link goes to a PDF – so they have some idea of what they are getting into.</p>
        <h3> Screen Reader</h3>
        <p>Whenever a screen reader (AT) encounters text in all capital letters, it will provide that content to the user in a louder, more forceful manner – MUCH AS WE MAY PERCEIVE IT AS YELLING WHEN READING IT and <strong>MAKING IT BOLD IS EVEN LOUDER!</strong></p>
